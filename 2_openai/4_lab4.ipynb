       "The AI‑agent landscape in 2025 matured from isolated scripts to interoperable, graph‑based ecosystems that combine prompting, tool‑calling, memory, and multimodal capabilities. The most widely adopted frameworks—LangChain + LangGraph, Microsoft Semantic Kernel (SK), LlamaIndex 2.0, CrewAI, AutoGPT‑Open, OpenAI Assistants SDK, Anthropic Prompt Engine, Haystack, Mistral‑AI Agent SDK, and the Rust‑based Open‑Source Agentic‑Kit—cover a spectrum from open‑source community hubs to enterprise‑grade, cloud‑native stacks. Adoption signals (GitHub stars, PyPI downloads, enterprise contracts, and cloud‑service integrations) show LangChain + LangGraph leading with ~150 k stars and 3 M monthly downloads, followed by Semantic Kernel (deep Azure integration) and LlamaIndex (data‑centric RAG). Multi‑agent collaboration frameworks such as CrewAI and AutoGen introduced task‑allocation, negotiation protocols, and shared memory, while safety sandboxes and policy engines became standard to satisfy regulatory demands. Low‑code tools (AutoGPT‑Next) broadened the user base, and plug‑in marketplaces accelerated reuse across domains.\n",
       "\n",
       "Forecasts for 2026 predict a consolidated market where three ADL‑compliant stacks dominate: **LangChain + LlamaIndex (“LangChain‑Index” stack)** (~32 % share), **Microsoft Semantic Kernel** (~21 %), and **AutoGen/OpenAI Assistants API** (~18 %). These frameworks benefit from emerging standards—the Agent Definition Language (ADL), OpenAI Function Calling v2, and the LLM‑Orchestration Interoperability (LOI) RFC—enabling agents defined once to run on any major cloud provider (Azure, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex). Semantic Kernel captures regulated‑industry spend through built‑in policy‑as‑code, while LangChain‑Index excels in data‑grounded workflows, and AutoGen/Assistants offers managed, cost‑predictable multi‑agent services for SaaS co‑pilot products.\n",
       "\n",
       "For stakeholders: enterprises should pilot Semantic Kernel for Azure‑centric, compliance‑heavy workloads and adopt LangChain‑Index for hybrid data‑centric agents; start‑ups aiming for rapid market entry should build on AutoGen + OpenAI Assistants and maintain an ADL‑compatible fallback to LangChain; investors should focus on LangChain Inc., CrewAI Labs, and Semantic Kernel‑backed startups. Aligning development with ADL and the upcoming LOI standard will ensure portability across managed cloud agent services and protect against vendor lock‑in, positioning adopters to capture the fastest‑growing segment of the AI market, projected to reach $5.2 B by 2026."
