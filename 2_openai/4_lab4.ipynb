       "**2025 Landscape of AI‑Agent Frameworks**  \n",
       "The most impactful releases of 2025 cluster around three themes: graph‑oriented orchestration, self‑critiquing tool‑calling loops, and enterprise‑grade runtimes with observability. LangChain 3.0 (May 2025) introduced LangGraph for declarative DAG workflows, a memory‑as‑service layer, and >100 new integrations, quickly becoming the de‑facto SDK for multi‑agent pipelines. AutoGen 0.4 (Sept 2025) delivered a role‑based multi‑agent engine with dynamic API discovery and self‑reflection, while OpenAI AgentKit (Nov 2025) added managed versioning, telemetry (OpenTelemetry), and a YAML‑based pipeline spec for production deployments. Parallel open‑source projects—CrewAI 2.0, Anthropic Bloom (policy‑as‑code safety), and IBM CUGA (hybrid governance)—expanded the toolbox for regulated sectors. Cloud providers responded with managed runtimes: Azure Foundry Agent Service, Google Vertex AI Agents, and AWS Bedrock Agent Runtime, all offering serverless execution, persistent memory, and built‑in compliance controls. No‑code platforms (LangFlow, n8n.ai Agentic Studio, OpenAI Agentic Studio) matured to visual authoring that exports to these underlying SDKs, democratizing agent creation across organizations.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Predictions for 2026 Dominance**  \n",
       "Analyst reports converge on a “purpose‑built agent layer” as the forthcoming standard: a separate identity, authentication, and policy engine (e.g., Agent‑DID, zero‑trust runtimes) that sits above any LLM. Frameworks that supply a composable, model‑agnostic SDK (LangChain/Cre wAI/LlamaIndex) combined with built‑in observability (real‑time metrics, hallucination detection, cost dashboards) and policy‑as‑code will dominate enterprise adoption. Cloud‑native “Agent‑as‑a‑Service” marketplaces (AWS, Azure, GCP, Cohere, Anthropic) will deliver pre‑packaged domain agents, while low‑code builders (Microsoft Power‑Agent, Bubble‑AI, Retool‑AI) will enable business users to instantiate them with a single click. Edge‑optimized runtimes and hybrid cloud‑edge deployments will also gain traction for latency‑critical use cases. Consequently, the stack that will likely become dominant in 2026 comprises: (1) a secure identity/governance layer, (2) a modular orchestration SDK (LangChain‑style), (3) model‑agnostic adapters, (4) managed observability and cost controls, and (5) visual low‑code front‑ends that generate production‑ready code. Selecting frameworks that embed these components—such as the evolving LangChain/LangGraph ecosystem paired with Azure or Vertex managed runtimes—will position organizations to meet regulatory, scalability, and security demands while retaining flexibility across LLM providers."
