    "\n",
    "STEP 1 - Generate Drafts: \n",
    "Use all three sales_agent tools to generate three different email drafts. Do not proceed until all three drafts are ready.\n",
    "IMPORTANT: Do NOT use the send_email tool in this step.\n",

    "STEP 3 - Send Email (ONLY AFTER STEP 2 IS COMPLETE):\n",

    "- You must use the sales agent tools to generate the drafts — do not write them yourself.\n",
