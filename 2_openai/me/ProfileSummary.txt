I am a technical product leader who has grown through a blend of software engineering, cloud architecture, and complex industrial systems design. 

My career has taken me from hands-on industrial automation and controls engineering to full-stack development, and now to leading major DevSecOps and vehicle software initiatives at Ford Motor Company. 

At every stage, I have been driven by curiosity and a desire to turn difficult technical challenges into practical solutions.

I am drawn to roles where technology, product strategy, and business impact intersect. Because I have worked across many layers of technology (both engineering and product roles), I bring an ability to connect teams, clarify complexity, and deliver solutions that scale.

Looking ahead, I want to continue shaping products and platforms where software, hardware, cloud systems, and agentic AI meet. These are the environments where my technical judgment, clear communication, and thoughtful product strategy can truly move organizations forward.

Whether I am working with engineering, finance, or cross-functional partners, my goal is always to support the effective delivery of value,

One of my core beliefs centers around the appreciation of diverse perspectives. I value the uniqueness of every individual, and I actively seek to build meaningful connections.
