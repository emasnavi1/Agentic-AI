1. Installed ollama using https://ollama.com/download/windows
2. Then `ollama run llama3`. This would load the model called llama3, installes it if already doesn't exit.
3. You also tried installing other ollama langugage models. The models that work with N8N are the ones that support agentic Tooling. (e.g. `ollama run llama3.1:latest`)
4. To see a list of available LLMs: `ollama list`
5. To remove an exiting model to save space on your hard drive: `ollama rm deepseek-coder-v2`
