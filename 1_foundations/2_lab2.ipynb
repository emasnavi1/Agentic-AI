Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations.<br/><br/>If you have time, I'd love it if you submit a PR for changes in the community_contributions folder - instructions in the resources. Also, if you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations.

Before producing final recommendations, do the following: (a) list up to eight clarifying questions you'd ask and briefly explain why each matters; (b) state the explicit assumptions you will adopt if those questions remain unanswered; (c) propose a prioritized, costed 10‑year adaptation strategy (including timelines, responsible actors, measurable metrics) that includes at least three nature‑based and three engineered interventions and specifies funding mechanisms; (d) identify concrete contingency triggers that would prompt accelerating, pausing, or reversing components of the plan; and (e) analyze trade‑offs across equity, resilience, long‑term fiscal costs, political feasibility, and likely unintended consequences—quantify expected costs/benefits and probabilistic risks where possible, and explain how you incorporate uncertainty into decision rules. Provide intermediate calculations and mark where expert local data would most change your recommendations.
