Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations.<br/><br/>If you have time, I'd love it if you submit a PR for changes in the community_contributions folder - instructions in the resources. Also, if you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations.

      "    *   **Description:** A risk-averse person experiences diminishing marginal utility for money. Gaining an additional $100 provides less \"happiness\" than losing $100 causes \"unhappiness.\" They prefer a certain outcome over an uncertain outcome with the same expected value, and they often require a *higher* positive expected value to take on risk. The pain of a sure loss (the $20 cost) might outweigh the potential thrill of a gain.\n",
      "    *   **Decision:** They **might not buy** the second ticket. Even though the EV is positive, the upfront $20 cost (a certain loss) for only a 30% chance to win $100 might be too risky for them. They might prefer to keep their $20 for certain, rather than risk it on a less than even chance, even if the math says it's a positive EV. For them, the *subjective value* of potentially losing $20 (with a 70% chance of not winning anything) could be greater than the *subjective value* of gaining $100.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Risk-Seeking Utility:**\n",
      "    *   **Description:** A risk-seeking person experiences increasing marginal utility for money (or simply enjoys the thrill of the gamble). The prospect of a large win is highly appealing, and they are willing to take risks, sometimes even for games with negative expected values.\n",
      "    *   **Decision:** They **would almost certainly buy** the second ticket. Not only is the expected value positive, but the *thrill* of having a chance to win $100 for a $20 outlay is exciting to them. The potential upside and the act of gambling itself provide them with additional utility beyond just the monetary expected value.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, based purely on expected monetary value, you should buy the second ticket. However, if you are risk-averse, you might decide against it due to the certainty of the $20 cost versus the uncertainty of the $100 win. If you are risk-seeking, you'd jump at the chance.\n",
