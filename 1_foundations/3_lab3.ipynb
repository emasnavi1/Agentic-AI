This\\nservice, akin to \"Airbnb for test environments\", enables software developers,\\nverification and validation teams, and automation pipelines to reserve and\\nutilize shared test resources, eliminating the need for costly, dedicated\\nhardware allocations per team.\\nThe service extends beyond static environments by introducing dynamic,\\ncloud-based test setups tailored to diverse ECU software testing needs,\\nprovisioned on demand and seamlessly integrated into CI/CD workflows\\nthrough robust API and CLI interfaces.\\nMy cross-disciplinary expertise in software engineering, cloud infrastructure,\\nand Kubernetes has been instrumental in driving technical architecture\\ndecisions, aligning cross-functional teams, and delivering a scalable & reliable\\nsolution. This initiative marks the first innovation of its kind at Ford in over\\n15 years, delivering measurable impact: improved resource efficiency, faster\\ndevelopment cycles, earlier defect detection, and reduced risk of costly recalls.\\nVehicle Software Update Technical Product Manager\\nSeptember 2021\\xa0-\\xa0November 2024\\xa0(3 years 3 months)\\nWaterloo, Ontario, Canada\\nIn my role as a senior member of the technical product management team,\\nI led transformative initiatives to modernize software release and integration\\nsystems, driving innovation, cost savings, and operational efficiency at Ford\\nMotor Company.\\nThe following is a summary of my key achievements in this role:\\n\\xa0 Page 2 of 7\\xa0 \\xa0\\n[+] Modernization of ECU Software Release Systems and Enablement of\\nSoftware Factory:\\nSpearheaded the transformation of a 30-year-old manual software release\\nprocess by introducing modern CI/CD, software release and versioning\\npractices, enabling 100+ hardware teams to adopt streamlined workflows. This\\ninitiative laid the foundation of modernization of ECU software delivery and\\nredefined Ford\\'s software release framework, improving delivery cycles and\\nintegrating supplier-developed software into CI/CD systems. The result was\\nfaster, higher-quality over-the-air updates, enhancing Ford\\'s ability to deliver\\ncutting-edge software at scale.\\n[+] Cross-Platform Integration System Assessment and Optimization:\\nPerformed a comprehensive evaluation of an unreliable cross-platform\\nintegration system intended to synchronize content across platforms and tools\\nsuch as MagicDraw, JAMA, JIRA, and TestRail. Identified critical inefficiencies\\nand recommended the discontinuation of a contract with the provider of\\nthe solution, resulting in $1.2M in annual savings for Ford Motor Company.\\nSimultaneously spearheaded the assessment of a cloud-based alternative,\\nleveraging Google Cloud expertise to prototype and validate its capabilities.\\nDelivered a clear and comprehensive executive report with actionable insights,\\nenabling leadership to implement a scalable and reliable integration solution.\\nATS Automation, Illuminate Digital Solutions\\nFull Stack Software Engineer\\nFebruary 2021\\xa0-\\xa0August 2021\\xa0(7 months)\\nKitchener, Ontario, Canada\\nAs a member of the Illuminate digital solutions team at ATS, I contributed to\\nthe development of world-class software solutions catering to data collection,\\nanalysis, and reporting needs of sophisticated industrial automation equipment\\nand production lines.\\nThe following is a summary of my key achievements in this role\\n[+] Integration of an event-triggered industrial video capture system into the\\ncore product:\\n\\xa0 Page 3 of 7\\xa0 \\xa0\\nLed the integration of an event-triggered video capture system, originally\\ndeveloped by the R&D team, into the ATS Illuminate platform and transformed\\nit into production-ready software. This enhancement enabled the platform to\\nexpedite troubleshooting in automated manufacturing systems by providing\\nprecise video insights. The system captures video at the exact point of interest,\\nincluding pre-event and post-event footage at the time of a fault condition.\\nThis work advanced the platform\\'s functionality, delivering value to users\\nby enabling faster and more effective resolution of complex or intermittent\\nmanufacturing issues. I achieved this by establishing a close partnership with\\nthe R&D team and developing the functionality and required APIs in .NET,\\noptimized SQL queries, and Angular JS-based user interfaces.\\nAngstrom Engineering Inc.\\nSenior Automation Systems Software Engineer \\nNovember 2017\\xa0-\\xa0July 2020\\xa0(2 years 9 months)\\nKitchener, Ontario, Canada\\nAs a senior member of the software & controls engineering team, I played a\\npivotal role in the design and development of control systems and interface\\nsoftware for a wide range of equipment, robots and thin film deposition\\nsystems.\\nThe following is a summary of my key achievements in this role.\\n[+] Development of Data Visualization Tool for Thin film Deposition Systems:\\nDeveloped and integrated a data visualization tool for Angstrom Engineering\\'s\\nthin film deposition systems, capable of handling process logs of varying\\ndurations (a few hours to several days long), and real-time visualization of live\\ndata. This innovative solution replaced labor-intensive manual analysis with an\\nintuitive interface, significantly improving productivity and user experience for\\nscientists and operators utilizing Angstrom Engineering\\'s systems.\\n[+] Development of Drivers for High Accuracy Thin Film Deposition Sensors:\\nDeveloped driver software for high-accuracy thin film deposition measurement\\nsensors, enabling Angstrom Engineering to integrate more reliable sensors\\ninto their core product platforms. Previously, the products relied on costly\\nPCI Express cards to read sensitive data, which had bandwidth limitations\\nthat restricted the number of sensors per system. My software eliminated the\\nneed for these expensive cards, removing sensor limitations and significantly\\n\\xa0 Page 4 of 7\\xa0 \\xa0\\nenhanced scalability. This solution reduced costs, improved product efficiency,\\nand boosted customer satisfaction, empowering Angstrom to deliver more\\nversatile, high-performance solutions.\\nSytrix Lab Technologies Inc.\\nCo-Founder\\nFebruary 2016\\xa0-\\xa0March 2018\\xa0(2 years 2 months)\\nWaterloo, Ontario, Canada\\nAs the co-founder of Sytrix Lab, I led the development of a unique, flexible,\\nand intelligent automated vision inspection solution targeting small to medium-\\nsized manufacturers in the automotive, plastic injection, and pharmaceutical\\nindustries.\\nSytrix Lab Technologies was an early-stage startup that developed a flexible,\\naffordable, and intelligent automated vision inspection platform. \\nUnder my leadership, the company secured significant funding by winning\\ncompetitive startup contests, including prestigious awards from Velocity and\\nAC JumpStart programs, backed by the University of Waterloo\\nBy leveraging advanced PC-based control and vision systems, as well as\\nreal-time cloud connectivity, our automated QC system significantly reduced\\ntime and resource expenditures while enhancing quality control procedures.\\nDespite this innovation, the company was discontinued due to funding\\nchallenges and personal matters among the co-founders.\\nNumalliance\\nIntermediate Control and Automation Systems Engineer\\nJuly 2015\\xa0-\\xa0November 2017\\xa0(2 years 5 months)\\nBrantford, Ontario, Canda\\nI led the design and development of cutting-edge PC-based control software\\nthat transformed the performance of tube-bending CNC machines with up\\nto 10 axes of motion.
